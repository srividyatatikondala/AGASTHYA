# Green Hydrogen Project

The Green Hydrogen Project aims to reduce air pollution by generating hydrogen through electrolysis, with water as a byproduct, resulting in zero emissions. Hydrogen produced through this process can be used as a clean energy source for various applications, including transportation, heating, and electricity generation.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the documentation, code, and resources related to the Green Hydrogen Project. The project is divided into the following components:

1. **Hydrogen Production**: Utilizes electrolysis to produce hydrogen gas from water, with zero carbon emissions.
2. **Chatbot**: A chatbot system integrated with the project to provide information and answer user queries regarding green hydrogen technology.
3. **Website**: A website designed to provide comprehensive information about the project, its objectives, and the benefits of green hydrogen technology.

## How It Works

The Green Hydrogen Project operates by using renewable energy sources to power the electrolysis process, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gas produced can then be stored and utilized as a clean and sustainable energy source, without contributing to air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Green Hydrogen Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary hardware and software components for hydrogen production.
3. Explore the codebase for the chatbot and website components.
4. Deploy the chatbot and website to your preferred hosting platform.
